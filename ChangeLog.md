# Changes Between 1.0.0-alpha1 and 1.0.0-alpha2

### Clojure 1.6 By Default

Project now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.6.0`. It is
still compatible with Clojure 1.4 and if your `project.clj` depends on
a different version, it will be used, but 1.6 is the default now.

We encourage all users to upgrade to 1.6, it is a drop-in replacement
for the majority of projects out there.
